### Hi there

👋 I'm Sam, a Front End Developer living in Canada.

📚 I'm a natural problem-solver and life-long learner who is not afraid of a challenge. I believe being able to have fun on the job makes any project possible.

### How did you get a README on your GitHub profile page?

🥚 Looks like GitHub hid a few easter eggs in their latest release! You can get a README to display on your GitHub profile if you do the following:

1. Create a new public repository, and name it the exact same as your username (in my case, my username is "SamSverko", so I created a public repository named "SamSverko").
2. Add a `README.md` file to the root of that newly created repository. Voila! The README will be automatically added to your GitHub profile.
